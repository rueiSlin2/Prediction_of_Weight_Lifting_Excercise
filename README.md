# Prediction_of_Weight_Lifting_Excercise
This report predicts the manner in which the subjects performed weight lifting exercises. This report utilizes machine learning algorithoms  using a single R markdown document that can be processed and transformed into an HTML file. The goal of this analysis is to predict the manner in which the subjects performed weight lifting exercises. The data is collected from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants. The outcome variable has five classes and the total number of predictors are 159.

I have tried a few number of algorithoms (e.g Decision Tree, Random Forest and Boosting) and I tried to optimize those models by adjusting tuning the parameters. Finally, I ensemble the models in order to further improve the model performance. After training each model, I compare the accuracies and choose the best model that has the lowest out of sample error. My prefered model is Random Forest and the accuracy obtained from this model is 0.9988105.
